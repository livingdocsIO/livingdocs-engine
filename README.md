# Livingdocs Engine

The engine is the central piece of livingdocs and defines the APIs for manipulating, displaying and storing the document.

For a more detailed documentation see our [livingdocs documentation](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs). For a quick overview stay right here.


## Usage

Load the necessary scripts into your browser.

```html
<!-- dependencies of livingdocs-engine -->
<script src="/jquery/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="/editable/editable.js"></script>

<!-- design -->
<script src="/designs/bootstrap/design.js"></script>

<!-- livingdocs-engine. yeah! -->
<script src="/livingdocs-engine.js"></script>
```

#### Global variable:

The engine then sets the global variable `doc`. Here you'll find the API of the `engine`.

#### Load a design into the engine:

```javascript
doc.design.load(design.bootstrap);
```
If you want to create your own design get started with the [livingdocs-design-boilerplate](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-design-boilerplate) project.

#### Create a new livingdoc:

```javascript
var livingdoc = doc.new({
  design: 'bootstrap'
});
```

#### Create views:

Simply render a livingdoc into your current page:

```javascript
livingdoc.appendTo({ host: '.article-container', interactive: false });
```

Create multiple views in iframes:

```javascript
var interactiveView = livingdoc.createView({ host: '.editor-section', interactive: true });
var preview = livingdoc.createView({ host: '.editor-preview' });
```

With the iframe technique you can isolate CSS or Javascript that is needed in your documents and also generate views that will work properly with responsive designs. There can only be one interactive view where the user can edit, but you can have as many readOnly views as you want to preview the content at different screen sizes at the same time.


#### Add content programmatically:

```javascript
// Create a component
var titleComponent = livingdoc.createComponent('title');
titleComponent.set('title', "My Title");

// Appned the component to the livingdoc
livingdoc.componentTree.append(titleComponent);
```

## Build (and Release)

#### Build

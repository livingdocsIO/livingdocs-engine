# SnippetContainer
# ----------------
# A SnippetContainer contains and manages a linked list
# of snippets.
#
# The snippetContainer is responsible for keeping its snippetTree
# informed about changes (only if they are attached to one).
# 
# @prop first: first snippet in the container
# @prop last: last snippet in the container
# @prop parentSnippet: parent Snippet
